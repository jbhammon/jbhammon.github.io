        <p>I’m a designer who cares about the environment, privacy, and which book to read next. I believe UX design is a way I can have fun and also make a positive impact on the world.</p>

        <p>I was born and raised in Michigan, and I attended the University of Michigan where I concentrated in Informatics. Then I spent a few years working with electronic health record software, before being drawn towards the design field. I’m currently back at UM, and working on my master’s in UX Research and Design.</p>

        <p>Data visualization is what fascinates me, and you can often find me browsing <a href = "https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful">r/dataisbeautiful</a> when I’m procrastinating. I’m hoping to combine my technical background with the design principles I’m learning now to find new and better ways to present complicated data to users.</p>

        <p>In my free time I like to get outside and stay active, read, cook, and practice drumset. I also love flowers and great food, and I plan my vacations around which botanical gardens and restaurants to visit. I highly recommend the garden at Utrecht University and the Wright Brothers seafood merchant in London!</p>
