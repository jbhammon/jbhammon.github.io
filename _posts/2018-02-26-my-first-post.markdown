This is my first post! Really this will just be something to help make sure I understand the naming conventions Jekyll requires, and to get some practice with the Github git GUI tool I downloaded.

Soon to come will be an outline of what I'd like this site to become over the next few weeks, and the beginnings of my first project to be shown off here! I've got some sketches of a dashboard I designed that I'd like to get added on here.

I'm really glad I'm getting back into creating things. I didn't realize how much I would miss it.
