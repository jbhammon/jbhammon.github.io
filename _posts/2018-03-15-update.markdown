I wanted to post a quick update of what I'm planning to work on next here!

First, I created a webpage for my old "Pokemon in Python" project, and linked to
it under the Projects section. I'm going to use that to practice building stuff
with the Boostrap framework I learned about on Codecademy.

Next, I'm working on finding a good tool to start creating the mock ups I sketched
up in my previous post. I need to create a new page to post everything I'll be
creating for that, and then I'll be posting iterations of my designs there.
