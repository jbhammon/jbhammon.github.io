            <h2>A New Degree Details Experience</h2>
            <p>The content library on Michigan Online is growing rapidly, and their catalog of online degrees is becoming increasingly popular. Pursuing an online degree from the University of Michigan is a large investment of time and money, and many learners will want to do lots of research before making their decision. An improved experience needed to be designed and developed to give learners the detailed information they’re seeking during their research.</p>

            <p>Learning experiences that are considered Courses, Series, or Teach-Outs have their own “Details” page on Michigan Online. However, a similar page did not exist for online degrees listed on Michigan Online. Each degree only had a short paragraph explaining the degree and a short promo video for learners.</p>

            <p>Coursera has plenty of information about the available online degrees. That is where students watch the lecture videos for the MOOCs and online degrees they’re enrolled in, and those individual Coursera pages are maintained by the respective U-M colleges who offer the degrees.</p>
            <p>However, Michigan Online wants to provide its users with that information as well. We needed to design an experience to answer potential learners’ questions about the degrees while minimizing the maintenance costs for the Michigan Online team.</p>

            <h4>Needfinding and Competitive Evaluation</h4>
            <p>I interviewed various Academic Innovation stakeholders to identify the types of learners the new Degree Details page should target and which questions it needs to help answer.</p>
            <p>Together we identified two target learners we wanted to design this page for. They were learners who are considering if a graduate degree is something they should pursue, and learners who are debating between residential and online graduate degree programs. They questions we wanted to answer regarded ideas like the intended audience of the degree, subject matter of the courses, and the costs of tuition and fees.</p>
            <p>After defining our audience, I reviewed how other online degrees are advertised to potential learners. The online learning platforms Coursera and EdX served as my primary sources, but I also reviewed several other universities’ online degree listings to help further understand what information our Degree Details page would need to provide.</p>

            <h4>Iterative Improvements</h4>
            <p>Our design process was very iterative and helped us incorporate a large amount of feedback into the final product. I would create several mockups and present them to other members of the Michigan Online design team to gather feedback on the information hierarchy and how well it matched with Michigan Online’s brand and visual identity.</p>
            <p>Once the design team was happy with a round of mockups I would present them to the entire Michigan Online team for feedback. This helped form exactly what information would be included in the final product.</p>

            <p>Our first round of mockups. We were just getting an idea of how to lay out the information together on one the page. The “why study this degree?” and “who is this degree for?” sections persisted through to the final product.</p>

            <h5>Second Iteration</h5>
            <p>Next round I started experimenting with the header of the page. Until now the most significant learning experience on Michigan Online is a “Series”, a sequential collection of Courses, which didn’t compare to the work a full degree requires. We wanted to give the degree details page a stronger presence.</p>

            <p>Next, we started focusing on all the specific content the page needs, and we experimented with using colors and whitespace to divide up the information to emulate Michigan Online’s homepage. Stakeholders were happy with the information we included in the Degree Details page. However, that resulted in a very long page, and required users to scroll a lot to find what they’re looking for.</p>

            <h3>Implementation</h3>
            <p>Once the final design iteration above was approved by Academic Innovation’s Associate Vice Provost and the rest of the Michigan Online team I was tasked with implementing the front end of the page. I constructed the necessary HTML and Less/CSS to build the framework and styling for each of the Degree Details pages.</p>
            <p>When I completed my development I worked closely with the software development team to outline the new Django data models we would need to support the Degree Details page. Together we created a generalized Django template that could be utilized for any new online degree that Michigan Online adds to their database.</p>
