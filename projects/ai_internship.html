            <h2>Large Project: Degree Details Design and Implementation</h2>
            <p>The content library on Michigan Online is growing rapidly, and their catalog of online degrees is becoming increasingly popular. Pursuing an online degree from the University of Michigan is a large investment of time and money, and many learners will want to do lots of research before making their decision. An improved experience needed to be designed and developed to give learners the detailed information they’re seeking during their research.</p>

            <h3>Previous State</h3>
            <p>Learning experiences that are considered Courses, Series, or Teach-Outs have their own “Details” page on Michigan Online. However, a similar page did not exist for online degrees listed on Michigan Online. Each degree only had a short paragraph explaining the degree and a short promo video for learners.</p>

            <h3>Need for More Information</h3>
            <p>Coursera has plenty of information about the available online degrees. That is where students watch the lecture videos for the MOOCs and online degrees they’re enrolled in, and those individual Coursera pages are maintained by the respective U-M colleges who offer the degrees.</p>
            <p>However, Michigan Online wants to provide its users with that information as well. We needed to design an experience to answer potential learners’ questions about the degrees while minimizing the maintenance costs for the Michigan Online team.</p>

            <h4>Needfinding and Competitive Evaluation</h4>
            <p>I interviewed various Academic Innovation stakeholders to identify the types of learners the new Degree Details page should target and which questions it needs to help answer.</p>
            <p>Together we identified two target learners we wanted to design this page for. They were learners who are considering if a graduate degree is something they should pursue, and learners who are debating between residential and online graduate degree programs. They questions we wanted to answer regarded ideas like the intended audience of the degree, subject matter of the courses, and the costs of tuition and fees.</p>
            <p>After defining our audience, I reviewed how other online degrees are advertised to potential learners. The online learning platforms Coursera and EdX served as my primary sources, but I also reviewed several other universities’ online degree listings to help further understand what information our Degree Details page would need to provide.</p>

            <h4>Iterative Improvements</h4>
            <p>Our design process was very iterative and helped us incorporate a large amount of feedback into the final product. I would create several mockups and present them to other members of the Michigan Online design team to gather feedback on the information hierarchy and how well it matched with Michigan Online’s brand and visual identity.</p>
            <p>Once the design team was happy with a round of mockups I would present them to the entire Michigan Online team for feedback. This helped form exactly what information would be included in the final product.</p>

            <p>Next round I started experimenting with the header of the page.

            <p>When I completed my development I worked closely with the software development team to outline the new Django data models we would need to support the Degree Details page.

            <h2>Small Project: Learner Progress Cards</h2>
            <p>The Michigan Online team was designing a new experience called "My Learning" for users to help them view the progress they've made across all the MOOCs they participated in through Michigan Online.

            <h2>Small Project: Heuristic Evaluation</h2>
            <p>When I started my position at AI I completed a heuristic evaluation of the Michigan Online website to become acquainted with the site’s functionality, flow, and visual identity. A few months prior the site had published a large visual redesign, and my manager wanted a fresh set of eyes to find any potential usability issues the team had missed. </p>
            <img class='screenshot' src='../assets/ai_internship/heuristic_eval_notes.png' alt='Spreadsheet of results from the heuristic evaluation'>
            <p>I evaluated the website using Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics and tracked each violation I found. I recorded the heuristic violated, its severity, and a potential fix for each instance, and noted the “Match between the system and the real world” and “Consistency and standards” heuristics were violated most often. I presented my top findings to the rest of the Michigan Online team and outlined them below.</p>

            <h3>Confusing Call-to-Action Buttons</h3>
            <p><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Heuristic: </span>Consistency and standards</p>
            <p><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Violation: </span>The "Start" call-to-action button for “Teach Out” learning experiences doesn't act the same as CTA buttons on other course pages. Clicking the “Start” button doesn’t currently start anything for users. CTA buttons on the other course pages take users to new pages, windows, or websites. From the “Overview” section clicking it will take users to the “Lessons” section. Clicking from the “Lessons” section doesn’t seem to do anything.</p>
            <img class='screenshot' src='../assets/ai_internship/heuristic_eval_1.png' alt='Call to action button screenshot'>
            <p><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Potential Fix: </span>Scrolling the user down the page to the top of the list of lessons could help give users a better sense they're "starting" something.</p>

            <h3>Unclear Course Ratings</h3>
            <p><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Heuristic: </span>Match between system and the real world</p>
            <p><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Violation: </span>There’s little transparency for a course’s ratings, but users are probably used to having that information from their other online experiences. The number of individual ratings for a course is not displayed, and there is no breakdown of how the overall rating is calculated. Users also have no control over the reviews they’re shown; it’s a fixed part of the screen.</p>
            <img class='screenshot' src='../assets/ai_internship/heuristic_eval_2.png' alt="Comparison between MO's ratings and Amazon's ratings">
            <p><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Potential Fix: </span>Include the total count of ratings in parentheses after the average star rating. Also, allow users to have control over the reviews they see. Give them links for "Next 5" and "Previous 5" reviews, for example.</p>

            <h3>Ambiguous Class Attributes</h3>
            <img class='screenshot' src='../assets/ai_internship/heuristic_eval_3.png' alt='Course attributes screenshot' style='float: right; max-height: 75vh'>
            <p><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Heuristic: </span>Match between system and the real world</p>
            <p><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Violation: </span>Students might not understand what the attribute "Status" means on a course or series page. A “status” of “available” doesn’t map to anything used to describe a typical in-person class students would register for.</p>
            <p><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Potential Fix: </span>Using a word like "Enrollment" might work better than "Status". Options below it could be "open", "closed", "rolling", "starting soon", etc. MOOCs aren’t very similar to typical college courses, but it would still be worth exploring other terminology that is more typically associated with classes.</p>

            <h2>Small Project: Partner Offering Page</h2>
            <p>Michigan Online isn't the only online source for learning content created across U-M's various campuses, and we needed to create a new page to advertise content from those other partners. I was given high-fidelity prototypes of a new "Partner Offerings" page and tasked with developing the new webpage. Using a combination of existing HTML and CSS assests developed by the MO team and new assets I developed myself I replicated the designs and presented my work to the Michigan Online team.</p>
            <p>My development work used a hard-coded list of partner cards, but our solution needed to update dynamically. I worked with a software developer fellow to replace my hard-coded list with a templated solution that the Django back-end could populate. Based on my front-end work she was able to update the Django data model to include the data I needed, and we worked together to integrate everything in the HTML template. Check out the <a href='https://online.umich.edu/partner-offerings/' target ='_blank'>Partner Offering page here!</a></p>
