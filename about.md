I'm a designer who cares about the environment, privacy, and which book to read next. I believe UX design is a way I can have fun and also make a positive impact on the world.

I was born and raised in Michigan, and I attended the University of Michigan where I concentrated in Informatics. Then I spent a few years working with electronic health record software, before being drawn towards the design field. I'm currently back at UM, and working on my master's in UX Research and Design.

Data visualization is what fascinates me, and you can often find me browsing r/dataisbeautiful when I'm procrastinating. I'm hoping to combine my technical background with the design principles I'm learning now to find new and better ways to present complicated data to users.

In my free time I like to get outside and stay active, read, cook, and practice drumset. I also love flowers and great food, and I plan my vacations around which botanical gardens and restaurants to visit. I highly recommend the garden at Utrecht University and the Wright Brothers seafood merchant in London!
